    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe was created for a Cinco De Mayo work potluck taco bar that was a big hit.
    The coffee in the recipe adds a hint of smokiness and assists with tenderizing the meat as it cooks. 
    Serve with warm tortillas and your favorite toppings. For less heat, omit jalapenos.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, sliced into thin rings</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed</li>
        <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans chili-seasoned diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can beef broth</li>
        <li>1 cup cold coffee</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles</li>
        <li>2 jalapeno peppers, sliced (Optional)</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Layer half the onion rings into the bottom of a slow cooker. Place chuck roast on top of onions.</li>
        <li>Pour diced tomatoes, beef broth, and coffee into the cooker over the roast; stir in diced green chiles, jalapeno peppers, garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and black pepper. Spread remaining onion rings over the mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover the cooker and cook on Low until beef is very tender, 6 to 10 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer chuck roast to a bowl and shred meat. Return meat to sauce. Remove onions and serve with meat.</li>
